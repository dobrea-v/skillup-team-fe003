                    <hr>
                    <p>I was born and raised in Moldova and found a passion for numbers and math. 
                        I studied economics, accounting specialty. In the last few years,  I work in a leasing 
                        company as an accountant. 
                     <br><br>
                        I want to discover frontend world and now I am studying it. It looks interesting, 
                        difficult but at the same time fun.
                     <br> <br>
                        When I am not workinging, i love travelling, playing football and walking with my friends.
                         I also enjoys good food and wine.
